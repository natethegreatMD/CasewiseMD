# Active Context: Casewise

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective: MVP Validation with TCGA-09-0364
The immediate focus is validating the complete diagnostic workflow using the single test case TCGA-09-0364, ensuring all system components work together seamlessly for the end-to-end user experience.

### Current Sprint Goals
1. **OHIF Viewer Integration**: Transition from hosted viewer to embedded solution
2. **Rubric Grading Validation**: Ensure JSON-based evaluation system works accurately
3. **Diagnostic Workflow Completion**: End-to-end case interaction testing
4. **Data Pipeline Verification**: Confirm DICOM data handling and report accuracy

## Recent Changes

### System Architecture Updates
- **Frontend Structure**: React application with DiagnosticWorkflow.tsx as main orchestrator
- **Backend Implementation**: Python MCP server with modular route structure
- **DICOM Data Organization**: TCGA-09-0364 case properly structured in demo_cases/
- **Viewer Components**: Multiple OHIF integration approaches implemented

### Code Organization
- **Component Separation**: DicomViewer.tsx, OhifViewer.tsx, OhifIframeViewer.tsx created
- **Route Modularity**: Separate diagnostic.py, grade.py, config.py in MCP backend
- **Rubric System**: JSON-structured evaluation criteria for multiple imaging modalities
- **Docker Configuration**: Container setup with Orthanc integration

### Recent Technical Decisions
- **OHIF Integration Strategy**: Currently using iframe approach while developing embedded solution
- **Grading Approach**: JSON rubrics as primary evaluation method, GPT integration deferred
- **Data Source**: TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive) confirmed as primary data source
- **Development Environment**: Docker-compose setup for full stack development

## Current Technical Status

### Working Components
- **React Frontend**: Core application structure and routing functional
- **Python Backend**: MCP server with API endpoints operational

- Performance acceptable for diagnostic use
- Integration seamless with React component lifecycle

### Priority 2: Complete Diagnostic Workflow
**Goal**: End-to-end case interaction from image viewing to feedback
**Tasks**:
- Connect OHIF viewer to diagnostic question prompts
- Implement response capture and processing
- Integrate rubric-based evaluation system
- Design feedback presentation interface

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can view DICOM images and answer diagnostic questions
- Responses are captured and evaluated against rubrics
- Feedback is immediate and educationally valuable
- Workflow matches oral board examination format

### Priority 3: Rubric Grading System
**Goal**: Accurate, consistent evaluation using JSON-structured rubrics
**Tasks**:
- Implement rubric parsing and scoring logic
- Validate evaluation accuracy against expert assessment
- Create feedback generation based on rubric scores
- Design rubric management and versioning system

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Rubric-based scores are consistent and accurate
- Feedback explains scoring rationale clearly
- System can handle multiple rubric formats
- Evaluation is auditable and explainable

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **OHIF Integration Complexity**: Large platform with complex build system
2. **DICOM Performance**: Large file sizes impact loading and rendering speed
3. **AI Evaluation Accuracy**: Ensuring rubric scoring matches expert judgment
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Docker environment vs. local development

### Product Challenges
1. **User Experience**: Balancing realism with usability
2. **Feedback Quality**: Making AI evaluation educationally valuable
3. **Case Complexity**: TCGA-09-0364 may be too complex for initial validation
4. **Scalability Planning**: Architecture decisions for multi-case expansion

### Process Challenges
1. **Medical Validation**: Ensuring clinical accuracy without medical expertise
2. **Performance Standards**: Defining acceptable speed and reliability metrics
3. **Testing Strategy**: Limited access to actual radiology residents for user testing
