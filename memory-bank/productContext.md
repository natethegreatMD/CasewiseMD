# Product Context: Casewise

## User Profile

### Primary User: Radiology Residents
**Role**: Medical trainees specializing in diagnostic imaging
**Experience Level**: Advanced medical students with 2-4 years clinical experience
**Technical Comfort**: Comfortable with medical software, DICOM viewers, PACS systems
**Learning Context**: Preparing for high-stakes oral board examinations

### Key User Characteristics
- **High Accuracy Requirements**: Zero tolerance for medical misinformation or AI hallucination
- **Time-Constrained**: Limited study time between clinical rotations
- **Performance-Oriented**: Success measured by board exam pass rates
- **Evidence-Based**: Requires explanations and rationale for all assessments
- **Collaborative**: Often studies in groups or with mentors

## Problem Space

### Current Pain Points

#### 1. Limited Realistic Practice Opportunities
- **Problem**: Few opportunities to practice oral board scenarios with real cases
- **Impact**: Residents feel unprepared for the format and pressure of oral exams
- **Current Solutions**: Textbook cases, peer practice sessions (limited availability)

#### 2. Inconsistent Feedback Quality
- **Problem**: Feedback depends on availability and expertise of attending physicians
- **Impact**: Learning progress is inconsistent and often delayed
- **Current Solutions**: Faculty mentorship (limited time), peer review (variable quality)

#### 3. Lack of Immediate Assessment
- **Problem**: Traditional case review provides delayed or no structured feedback
- **Impact**: Residents can't identify knowledge gaps quickly
- **Current Solutions**: Self-assessment (unreliable), delayed faculty review

#### 4. Artificial Case Materials
- **Problem**: Most educational materials use simplified or artificial cases
- **Impact**: Disconnect between study materials and real clinical scenarios
- **Current Solutions**: Textbook cases (oversimplified), purchased case libraries (expensive)

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue is the **gap between educational tools and clinical reality**. Current solutions either lack realism (textbook cases) or lack scalability (faculty mentorship).
