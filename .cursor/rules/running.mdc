- do not try to run docker or npm here locally. services are only run on my vps
- we are hosting the project on the vps
- do not use placeholders. everything built needs to be production ready. if you need a placeholder because you lack info, just ask me.
- give commands as one line when you want me to run things on the vps
- you can only test the backend locally. do not use docker.
