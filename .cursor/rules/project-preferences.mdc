- No placeholders. we prefer to use real code and real data. if a placeholder is needed, ask me what we should do or use.

- Everything should be developed with deployment in mind. We should not be testing with local host etc. we will test on the actual casewisemd website. Always use real link 

- Refer to the DNS Configuration at "/Users/newuser/Documents/casewise/casewise-vps/DNS Configuration" for our custom records and URLs
